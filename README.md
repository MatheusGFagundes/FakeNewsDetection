# Automatic Detection of Fake News in Portuguese

## Description

This repository contains a project of a master program for developing an automatic model for fake news detection in Portuguese. The goal of this project is to create a classifier that utilizes both syntactic  and lexical information and  to measure the contribution of syntactic structures in detecting fake news.

The project aims to explore the relationship between syntactic patterns and the presence of fake news in Portuguese. By analyzing the syntactic structures of news articles and combining them with lexics, the classifier will be able to identify indicators of fake news.

The project utilizes two corpora:

- **Fakebr**
- **FactBR**
